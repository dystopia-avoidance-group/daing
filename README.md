# intro rant
Technology can do amazing things, and the promises of technology
to solve actual, major problems grows every day. What also grows
every day is the possibility that this technology may be used for
purposes never intended by the creators.

Many tech visionaries are, by definition, dreamers. They see the
wonderful potential, and imagine the amazing future made possible
by the solutions they create. This is right and good. It is nice
to be swept up in the possibility of a shining future.

The purpose of this group is to dream darkly, to see what may go
wrong. We will do our best to twist bright visions and corrupt
happy dreams. And then we will do everything we can to stop them.

It is not enough to be doomsayers. We must envision solutions, we
must educate, and we must act.
